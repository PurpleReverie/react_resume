how am I going to do animated text in react

how do I want it to present

1) 1 seecond passes
2) text animates in at a constant speed
3) text finishes animates
4) this show cases the questions

this is a difficulty because I need to "initate" the child component

1) first build the a deterministic animation without state
2) then use a timestmp offset to offset the animation
3) then set up triggers outside of component to assign that offset
