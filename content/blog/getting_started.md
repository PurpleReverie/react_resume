# Hello world, TJ here!


If you reading this, it means you have found my resume web site. Thank you having a look and finding my first blog post. Its 2024 and after the covid pandemic the tech industry is over saturated (over hiring during the pandemic, rise of interest rates, anticipating a technological singularity from the rise of Large Language Models thanks to Open AI).


In this context I thought I would do something different and create my own website to act as my resume (using react). On the front page is an overview of my skills and work history, but since you have looked around already and found this blog I'll introduce myself in more detail.


I entered the tech industry making AR and VR experiences in Auckland New Zealand back in 2016. If you have been following tech for a while you would remember around 2016 the hype around Virtual Reality. Well, that hype bubbled fueled an AR VR start up scene in Auckland. As I was pursuing game development and used unity for almost everything, I got pulled into the scene, as at the time Unity had a lot of support for AR and VR applications.


As the work progressed in the AR and VR space I had to make more and more integrations with other systems, and through this I pivoted into full stack development. Creating bespoke projects for stake holders, where I have to develop systems and features over multiple different environments is incredibly rewarding, as its where I see the majority of value in modern software projects.


Now that I have a blog, I have a little corner of the internet where I can post some of my experiences. If your keen too following allow, key an eye out for additional posts!
