# My stamp on the internet

This very website you are reading is my resume website I built with react. I got frustrated with tailoring my resume for different applications so I thought I would create a whole website where I could document all my work. Its also a good exercise in react.

[Github Repo!](https://github.com/PurpleReverie/react_resume)

## Overview

This website is built entirely with react, and hosted via githubs pages. Not only is this website a but also a blog for myself. As a blog you would imagine it needs a CMS, but I got around this by setting up a compile system to take markdown and yaml files and create manifests. While this means I can't update the blog dynamically (I have to redeploy the site I add a blog or project entry), thats fine for me as I want it all hosted in github pages. A cms backend would be too much hosting costs at this point in time.

You can find my compile scripts under `./automation` in the github repo if you want an example of what how it works.
