overview: >
  The unity game engine as been my bread an butter of vast majority of career. Unity 3D is a comprehensive and widely-used game development platform that allows developers to create 2D and 3D games and simulations. It provides a powerful engine for rendering graphics, physics, and real-time interactions, along with an integrated development environment (IDE) for coding, asset management, and debugging. Unity supports multiple platforms, enabling developers to publish their creations across various devices, including PCs, consoles, mobile devices, and VR/AR systems. Its robust asset store, extensive documentation, and active community make Unity a popular choice for both indie developers and large studios.
