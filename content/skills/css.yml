  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of web pages. By separating content from design, CSS enables developers to maintain and update the look and feel of a site more efficiently. It supports responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
